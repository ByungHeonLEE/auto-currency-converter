## Currency Conversion Integration

To integrate automatic currency conversion into your site, include the following script in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.yourapi.com/currency-converter-sdk.js"></script>



### Security and Privacy:

When advising users to include third-party scripts in their websites, it's essential to highlight any security or privacy implications. Ensure your script does not collect any personal data without consent, and communicate your service's privacy practices clearly in your documentation.

### Conclusion:

The JavaScript snippet for currency conversion should be seen as an extension of your NestJS project's functionality, provided as a tool for your users to integrate your service easily into their websites. It's not part of the NestJS application itself but rather a client-side component that interacts with your application's API.
